Hi Andre,
Forgive me so laterly to reply your email of last year. It is really long time no say hi to you. How are you? It looks nice from the photos.

You known because of some political reason, Chinese govenment blocks goole and gmail web site scince last year(2014), so that means 
I have not received any email from gmail the email box and I either don't kown somebody have sent some message to me.
Until two weeks ago,because of working reason I need go through and search data from internet by google, so I decided to refer to some
special application to visite google ( it is shadowsocket ). And from that moment I can visitor gmail again, I seen the mail you sent to me, so .......

Yes I changed my job again from last year ( 2014.07 ). The new company called LeeLen technical Lt.,Co It is also a Chinese company, mainly production
is building conversation system. My duty is still software designe for embedded system. The reason why I changed my job is that I want to find a big platform
for my professional development. There is around 1500 in the LeeLen technical Lt.,Co. and the salary is better than old one. :-) 

My family is OK. In last sprint festival my wife and my daughter with me visited Disneyland in HomeKong. Rita found the tour was very nice and we take some pictures 
for the trip. I will attached them as a attachment for you.

In Sep.1 Rita will become a grade 1 student of elementary school. At that time we will move another place(still in XiaMen) to live where is nearly school Rita have.
