Hi Andre,
Forgive me so laterly to reply your mail of last year. It is really long time no say hi to you. How are you? It looks nice from your photos.

You known Chinese govenment blocks goole and gmail web site from last year(2014), so in other word I have not received any mail comes from
gmail.Until two weeks ago,because of working resean I need go through and search data from internet by google, so I decide to refer to some
special application to visite google ( it is shadowsocket ). And from that moment I can visitor gmail again, I seen the mail you sent to me.

Yes I changed my job again from last year ( 2014.07 ). The new company called LeeLen technical Lt,Co. It is also a Chinese company, mainly production
is building conversation system. My duty is still software designe for embedded system. The reason why I changed my job is that I want to find a big platform
for my profession.
